	There was an input field labeled "Input secret" and a submit button. 
	There was another link at the bottom saying `view sourcecode`.
	Link took to a sourcecode file, which included the php script where validation of input from the input field takes place.
	In there, the passed value is compared from to a value taken from `includes/secret.inc`

	I tried this path in the url and got the value of `secret variable`. Passed this value in the input field and got the password.
