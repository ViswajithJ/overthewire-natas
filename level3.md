There was a comment saying "No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time..."
This is a hint on robots.txt. The file `robots.txt` is used to indicate which parts of website, web crawlers and stuff like that are allowed to look into. 
Checkedout `robots.txt` by adding it at the end of url. Inside it was a note to disallow an endpoint `/s3cr3t/`
Went to `/s3cr3t/`. There was a file listed there called `users.txt` which contained the password for natas4.
