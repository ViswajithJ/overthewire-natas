<h2>ðŸ”° Level - 7</h2>

- username - natas7

	Site got links to two pages. One for `Home` and the other for `About` <br>
	Inside the index file, it can be seen that both these pages are accessed through `index.php?page=home` and `index.php?page=about`
	<br>
	This page variable/argument takes the name of the file to display.<br>
	Another hint was also given: `password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8` <br>
	So, I passed this path as value to the page variable, and got the password for level 8.
